England spoke first Danish and later French. These new settlers enriched the English language and especially its vocabulary. So by the 1600's Shakespeare was able to make use of a wider vocabulary than ever before. In 1620 some British settlers moved to America. Later in the 18th century some British people were taken to Australia too. English began to be spoken in both countries.
Finally by the 19th century the language was settled. At that time two big changes in English spelling happened: first Samuel Johnson wrote his dictionary and later Noah Webster wrote the American Dictionary of the English language. The latter gave a separate identity to American English spelling.
English now is spoken as a foreign or second language in South Asia. For example, India has a very large number of fluent English speakers because Britain ruled India from 1765 to 1947. During that time English became the language for government and education. English is also spoken in Singapore and Malaysia and countries in Africa such as South Africa. Today the number of people learning English in China is increasing rapidly. In fact, China may have the largest number of English learners. Will Chinese English develop its own identity? Only time will tell.
Standard English and dialects
....When people use words and expressions different from the "standard language", it is called a dialect. ..... American English has so many dialects because people have come from all over the world.
Geography also plays a part in making dialects. Some people who live in mountains of the eastern USA speak with an older kind of English dialect......Although many Americans move a lot, they still recognize and understand each other's dialects.
